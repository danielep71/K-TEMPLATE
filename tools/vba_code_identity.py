"""Compare two versions of an exported VBA component by its code, without comments.

A comment does not change what Excel runs. This module decides whether two
versions of a VBA component (.bas, .cls or .frm) hold the same code, so that
tools/check_excel_run.py --carried-to can carry the evidence of an Excel run
across a commit that changes only comments or layout. The code of a version
is its code stream: its logical lines as tools/vba_lexer.py reads them, the
lexer the VBA source checks use, with

- comments removed: from an apostrophe outside a string, or from Rem where a
  statement starts, and the lines of a comment continued with " _";
- continuation lines joined into their logical line, and blank lines dropped;
- conditional-compilation directives (#If, #Const ...) kept, and marked as
  directives, so that a changed directive or a changed statement inside an
  #If block is a code change;
- outside string literals, each run of white space made one space, and white
  space at the start and end of a line dropped. Inside a string literal every
  character is kept. White space is never inserted or removed between two
  tokens, so `a=1` and `a = 1` are different code;
- outside string literals, letters compared without case, because the VBE
  re-cases every use of a name (HB-01, as tools/check_excel_run.py compares an
  export with its commit). The re-cased identifiers are reported, not refused.

Any other difference is a code change. The comparison fails closed: a
non-ASCII byte, a commit or a file that cannot be read, or a file that is not
a VBA component refuses it (CarryRefused). A component that uses [ or ]
outside a string literal is always refused, changed or not: inside a [...]
expression an apostrophe, a colon, Rem and a quote do not mean what they mean
in a statement, so its comments cannot be told from its code with certainty.
A form's .frx resource is binary and never compared here; it must stay byte
for byte identical.
