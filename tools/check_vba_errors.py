"""Check VBA error handling: Err is copied before any other statement can change it.

A read of ``Err.Number``, ``Err.Source`` or ``Err.Description`` is reported
when, on the straight-line path that leads to it, a statement has already
cleared or may have replaced the error it means to read:

- an ``On Error`` statement or ``Err.Clear``, which clears ``Err``;
- in an error handler, a call or a member access (``Helper``, ``x = Helper(1)``,
  ``x = Helper`` without parentheses, ``obj.Method``, ``Debug.Print``,
  ``Application.StatusBar = ...``, ``New``), which can run code that clears
  or replaces it. A name without parentheses is a call unless it
  is a variable, a constant, an Enum member or a component: a function,
  property or Declare of the project, or a host global such as ActiveCell.
  Names that start with ``vb`` or ``xl`` are the constants of VBA and Excel.
  A name is resolved against the project first: a procedure, property or
  Declare of the module, or a public one of a standard module, shadows a VBA
  function, statement, statement target or constant of its name, as in VBA,
  while ``VBA.Format`` still names the VBA function. ``Err`` and ``Erl``
  always mean VBA's.
  A dotted name is a member access unless it reads a value (Scope.value): a
  field of a variable declared ``As`` a user-defined Type of the project
  (``Saved.Number``, ``Saved(i).Inner.Field``, ``.Number`` inside
  ``With Saved``), an Enum member (``RunStatus.rsFailed``,
  ``Module.RunStatus.rsFailed``), or a constant, Enum member or variable of
  a standard module that its name qualifies (``Module.LIMIT``). A variable
  of a class or object type, a class or document module and ``Me`` stay
  member accesses.
  In the same way, an assignment (``=``, ``Let``, ``Set``, ``LSet``,
  ``RSet``) to anything but a variable, such a field or value, an array
  element or a statement target (``Date``, ``Mid(Text, 1, 1)``) sets a
  property, a call made once the value is read: a Property Let or Set of
  the project, a member (``.Value = x`` in a ``With`` block) or a property
  of the host.

After ``On Error Resume Next``, and outside a handler, ``Err`` belongs to the
most recent statement that runs anything, since any of them can fail, even
``Number = 1`` (a type mismatch) or ``Matches = Text Like Pattern``: a read
after one checks it and is not reported. Only these leave ``Err`` as the
``On Error`` statement or ``Err.Clear`` cleared it: a declaration (``Dim``,
``Static``, ``Const``), a label, a blank line or a comment, ``With Err`` and
``End With``, and a write of a property of ``Err`` whose value runs nothing,
as in ``Err.Number = 0``.

In a handler, the VBA functions of PURE_FUNCTIONS (``CLng``, ``CStr``,
``Len``, ..., also written ``VBA.CLng``), operators, an array element and
the VBA statements of BUILTIN_STATEMENT (``ReDim``, ``Erase``, ``Open``,
``Print #``, ...) change nothing: they can fail but run no code that clears
``Err``. A VBA statement may be written with ``Call``, as in
``Call SaveSetting(...)``. Its operands alone are read as expressions,
without the type that ``ReDim`` declares (``As Long``), and the type in
``TypeOf x Is Thing`` is not a value. A statement that starts with any other
name is a call, ``Load`` and ``Unload`` included, since they run the form's
event procedures.

Within a statement, the check follows VBA's evaluation order: a read inside
the arguments of a call, as in ``CLng(Err.Number)``, runs before that call.
Only what runs before a read counts for it, under the same rules as the
statements before: after ``On Error Resume Next`` any name, call or operator
other than a literal, a constant or a property of ``Err`` refreshes ``Err``, and
in a handler a call or member access makes the read stale, as in
``Report Helper(), Err.Number``. An operator written before a read may run
after it, as ``&`` in ``a & b / Err.Number``; it counts as running before.
A name qualified by the VBA library or one of its modules (``VBA.CLng``,
``VBA.Strings.Len``, ``VBA.vbCrLf``, ``VBA.Beep``, ``VBA.Mid``) is VBA's, as
unqualified, whatever the project declares; a module name alone, as in
``Strings.Len``, only when no value, component or procedure of the project
has that name.
Reading or writing any property of ``Err`` (``Number``, ``Source``,
``Description``, ``HelpFile``, ``HelpContext``, ``LastDllError``) is data:
it changes nothing, and only a read of the first three is checked. Assigning
one (``Err.Description = x``) reads nothing of it, and ``.Number`` inside
``With Err`` reads ``Err.Number``. ``Err.Raise`` is a call.
``Err`` read through its default member (``n = Err``), ``Err`` passed to a
procedure and ``Erl`` are not followed.

A segment starts at each label and after each branch or loop statement:
``If``, ``Select Case``, ``Do``, ``For``, ``While``, ``Exit``, ``Resume``,
``GoTo``, ``Return`` and the statements that close them end the segment
being tracked. A single-line ``If`` is read as its condition, then each
branch on its own, as the statements it runs from the state after the
condition (an ``Else`` belongs to the nearest ``If``); the segment ends
after the line. What follows a branch is never claimed, so a finding is a
read that is stale on every path to it.

Inside a Function or Property Get, its own name is the result variable,
and with an argument list, as in ``Fetch(True)``, a call of itself, unless
the declared result is an array or a Variant, which an index may read: then
it counts as an element of the result.

Each compilation environment of check_vba_conditionals.py is analyzed
separately, and a finding names the environments it occurs in.
