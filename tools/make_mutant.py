"""Write a mutant of one source file: a copy with one piece of text replaced.

A mutant is the defective variant of a file, made reproducibly for a negative
control: the test that proves a fix must fail on it and pass on the fix
(CONTRIBUTING.md, *Negative controls*). The tool replaces the text that
--find gives with the text that --replace gives and changes nothing else.

    python tools/make_mutant.py FILE --find TEXT --replace TEXT [--output DIR]

The text is literal: no escape sequence and no pattern is interpreted. For a
text that spans lines, put it in a file and pass --find-file or
--replace-file instead; the whole file is the text, a final line ending
included. Line endings in the text are converted to those of FILE, so the
same text matches a CRLF and an LF checkout.

The mutant keeps FILE's path relative to the repository root, under the
output folder, test-results/mutants/ of the repository by default. FILE is
read and the mutant written as bytes, so every byte outside the replaced text,
CRLF line endings included, stays as it was. For an exported VBA component (a
.bas, .cls or .frm file), the Attribute VB_Name line must exist and stay the
same, and the replacement must be ASCII; a form's .frx is copied beside its
mutant, since the VBE imports a form only with it.

It refuses, and writes nothing, when:

- the text to find is not in FILE exactly once, overlapping occurrences
  included, so "aa" in "aaa" counts twice (it reports the count);
- the replacement would leave FILE unchanged;
- the replacement would change, remove or add an Attribute VB_Name line;
- the text spans lines and FILE mixes CRLF and LF line endings;
- the mutant's path, a form's .frx beside it or a folder between them and
  the output folder is a symbolic link, or the path resolves outside the
  output folder, so that a link left there never redirects the write;
- the output folder holds a tracked file, lies in a source directory (src/,
  tests/, tools/, docs/, .github/ or examples/), or Git does not ignore the
  mutant's path, so that a mutant can never be committed or replace a source;
- FILE or the output folder is outside the repository.

On success it prints the changed lines, with the line number where the
replaced text starts, and the SHA-256 of the source and of the mutant.
Each output is written to a new file and renamed over its path, so a file
already there, even a hard link to the source, is replaced and never
written through. Running it again replaces the mutant. Exit status: 0 when the mutant is
written, 1 when it refuses, 2 on a usage error.
