"""Check that every VBA jump target is a label of the procedure that jumps.

``GoTo``, ``GoSub``, ``Resume <label>`` and ``On Error GoTo <label>`` must
name a label defined in the same procedure, labels must be unique within a
procedure, and every procedure must be closed. Each compilation environment
of check_vba_conditionals.py is checked separately, so that mutually
exclusive ``#If`` branches are never combined.

A raise reached after a ``Resume <label>`` while one of the procedure's own
``On Error GoTo <label>`` handlers is enabled is reported: that handler
traps the raise again, so a handler that resumes to the same code loops,
and the error never reaches the caller. Raise a saved error after
``On Error GoTo 0``. A raise is ``Err.Raise`` or ``VBA.Err.Raise``, with or
without ``Call`` and named arguments, or the ``Error`` statement; a
``.Raise`` inside ``With Err`` is not seen. The model of the handler state:

- ``On Error GoTo <label>`` enables that local handler, ``On Error GoTo 0``
  disables it and ``On Error Resume Next`` replaces it. ``On Error GoTo -1``
  only ends the error-handling state, so the enabled handler stays enabled.
- A ``Resume <label>`` belongs to the handler whose label precedes it most
  closely, and re-enables that handler, which trapped the error. A
  ``Resume`` before any handler label is not followed.
- Only a ``Resume <label>`` that the handler runs unconditionally starts a
  path. One inside an ``If``, ``Select Case`` or loop of the handler, or in
  a one-line ``If``, runs only under a condition, as in a bounded retry, so
  it starts no path, and a raise it would loop through is not reported.
- From the ``Resume`` target, the check follows the text of the procedure.
  ``If``, ``Select Case`` and loop blocks merge the states of their
  branches. A one-line ``If ... Then a: b Else c: d`` is read as a block
  ``If`` whose branches hold the statements in order, up to the end of the
  line, and so is ``If x Then: a``. A combined ``Next j, i`` closes one
  loop per name, and ``Exit Do`` or ``Exit For`` leaves the innermost loop
  of its kind. Where the branches disagree, the state is unknown and
  nothing is reported.
- A ``GoSub`` or ``On ... GoSub`` whose subroutine runs an ``On Error``
  statement before its ``Return`` makes the state unknown; a raise inside
  the subroutine is not checked.
- A target inside blocks stays inside them: at the next ``ElseIf``,
  ``Else`` or ``Case`` of an enclosing block, the path skips to that block's
  end. At the end of an enclosing loop, the path continues after the loop;
  if the loop's body changes the handler, the state is unknown there, and a
  raise before the target in a later pass is not checked.
- The path ends at an ``Exit Sub``, ``Exit Function``, ``Exit Property``,
  ``End``, ``GoTo``, ``Resume`` or ``Return`` outside any block, and at the
  end of the procedure; inside a block, that branch ends there and takes no
  part in the merge. A raise ends the path in the same way when the handler
  is disabled or a local handler is enabled. Under ``On Error Resume Next``
  the raise falls through, and in an unknown state it falls through too, so
  that the branch keeps its unknown state in the merge and cannot produce a
  finding. ``Stop`` only pauses, so the path goes on.
  Jumps are not followed: the path goes on after an
  ``On ... GoTo`` list, which falls through when no target is chosen, and a
  label on the path does not merge the states of other jumps to it.
- ``Resume`` and ``Resume Next`` continue at a statement that cannot be known
  statically, so no path starts from them. A raise inside a handler before
  its ``Resume`` is not trapped by that handler, so it is not reported.
