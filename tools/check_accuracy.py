"""Check the accuracy contracts of the test cases, and measure them against an Excel run.

An accuracy contract (docs/methodology/TEST_CASES.md, Accuracy contracts) is the
worst error a calculation guarantees for one regime, over the outputs of its
quantities in two lists of cases: the calibration cases, which may be used to
set the threshold, and the holdout cases, which never are. The registry is
tests/accuracy/contracts.json. The threshold is the guarantee, which blocks;
an optional target, no larger, is the accuracy aimed for, which is only
reported. The registry may also declare invariants: properties that the
results of a calculation's cases always have, whatever any contract's status,
and whether or not a contract covers them:
- bounds: each number of a quantity is at least a minimum, at most a
  maximum, or both, with no tolerance (a domain rule);
- monotone: over an ordered list of cases or variants, a quantity does not
  decrease (non-decreasing) or does not increase (non-increasing) by more
  than the two outputs' own tolerances; a smaller reversal is only counted;
- sum: within each case, variant and scope, declared quantities add up to
  another quantity or to a constant, within the sum of their tolerances.

Without a results file, the check reads the registry against the cases:
- every contract is well formed, and its target, when it has one, is a finite
  number of at least 0 and no larger than its threshold;
- its calculation is declared by the calculation contracts;
- each of its cases tests that calculation and has an expected number for each
  of its quantities, and no case is both calibration and holdout;
- a frozen contract names the decision that froze it, is not illustrative, and
  has at least min_holdout_cases holdout cases, every expected value of which
  is published or independent;
- its design document, when it names one, is a file under docs/methodology/
  or tests/accuracy/;
- a contract frozen at the newest vX.Y.Z tag that HEAD contains is still
  frozen, and keeps its guarantee unless it names another decision: the same
  calculation, regime and metric, a threshold no larger, and every quantity
  and case it had. Its target may change under the same decision;
- every invariant is well formed, its calculation is declared, each of its
  cases tests that calculation and has the expected numbers it needs, and the
  expected values themselves keep it.

With --results, a results file of an Excel run, it also fails; repeated, it
measures the results files of several suites together:
- results of another revision: their commit is the full SHA of the candidate,
  --commit when given, HEAD otherwise;
- a result that two results files both hold;
- an output with no result;
- a result outside its expected output's own tolerance;
- a contract whose worst error, among its calibration or among its holdout
  outputs, exceeds its threshold;
- an output an invariant reads with no result, and a result that breaks an
  invariant.
It prints, for each split, the worst error, the threshold and the target, and
marks the target missed when the worst error is above the target but within
the threshold: that passes. It prints, for each invariant, what it checked,
and for a monotone one the reversals within the allowance.

The holdout exposure record, tests/accuracy/holdout_exposures.json, lists
each time a frozen contract's holdout was first measured under a decision.
A repository with a registry keeps it, with an empty list until a holdout is
first measured. A contract's holdout is measured only once its exposure under
its decision is recorded:
- a draft contract's holdout is sealed: --results measures its calibration
  cases only and prints that the holdout is sealed;
- a frozen contract with no exposure under its decision is sealed too, and
  with --results that is a finding: measure it once with --record-holdout;
- --record-holdout ACC-<n> writes the contract's exposure, then measures as
  --results does. The entry holds the contract ID, its decision, the number
  of exposures of its holdout so far, the commit and the SHA-256 of each
  results file, the SHA-256 of the canonical contract entry, its threshold,
  the SHA-256 of each holdout case's fixture and expected file, and the byte
  length and SHA-256 of the contract's design document when it names one. It
  refuses, writing nothing and measuring nothing, a draft contract, a
  contract already exposed under its decision, a missing, malformed or
  inconsistent record, a registry check with any finding, and results that
  are unusable or lack an output of the holdout. A record is never reset;
- any later --results run, such as tools/check_excel_run.py on a later
  candidate, measures a recorded holdout as a regression, prints its number
  of exposures and records nothing.
The check also fails, without results, on a record that is malformed or
inconsistent, an exposure whose contract is gone, an exposure recorded at
the newest vX.Y.Z tag that the record no longer starts with, and, for a
frozen contract under the decision of its last exposure, an entry, holdout
fixture or expected file that differs from the record, a lower threshold,
or a design document that no longer begins with the recorded bytes. A new
decision, which states the earlier exposures, ends these comparisons until
its own exposure is recorded.

The error is |a - e| for an absolute contract and |a - e| / |e| for a relative
one; a relative error at e = 0 is 0 when a = 0 and infinite otherwise. A
contract proves only what its cases and their references prove: an
illustrative contract validates nothing.
