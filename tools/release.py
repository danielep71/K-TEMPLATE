"""Verify, describe and package a release tag, and check the published release.

Subcommands, all read-only apart from the files that bundle writes:

- verify TAG --default-branch BRANCH [--excel-evidence DIR --workbook FILE]
  Fails unless:
  - TAG is vX.Y.Z and annotated;
  - X.Y.Z is the newest dated release of CHANGELOG.md and the content of
    VERSION at the tag;
  - the tag's commit is on origin/BRANCH;
  - the tag message names that commit on a "Candidate <sha>." line and has
    a "Deviations:" line followed by text on the same line, such as "none",
    or by a list on the next lines, as RELEASING.md requires;
  - when the tag's commit holds a VBA component (a .bas, .cls or .frm file
    anywhere in its tree, as tools/check_excel_run.py compares them), the
    message declares its Excel run on one line
    "Excel evidence: <digest> (run <run sha>)." or lists an
    "- Invariant 4: <text>" item under "Deviations:". "Deviations: none."
    does not waive the run. A line that starts "Excel evidence:" in any
    other form fails, with or without a VBA component.
  Without --excel-evidence, as in the Release workflow, the declaration is
  checked for its form only: the evidence never leaves the machine it was
  recorded on. With --excel-evidence and --workbook, on that machine before
  the tag is pushed, the message must declare the evidence, and the gate of
  the evidence subcommand must pass for the tag's commit and the declared run
  commit, with the declared digest.
- evidence COMMIT --excel-evidence DIR --workbook FILE [--run-commit SHA]
  The Excel evidence gate, run before tagging. It runs the checks of
  tools/check_excel_run.py with --require-binding on the evidence folder DIR
  and the workbook FILE, in process: against COMMIT, or against SHA, the
  commit the workbook was built from, with --equivalent-to COMMIT, so that
  every run input must have the same Git blob at both commits. It fails on
  any finding, on a binding other than VERIFIED, on a run of another commit
  without the Equivalent result, and on carried evidence, which it never
  asks for. On success it prints the evidence digest and the line to put in
  the tag message. The digest is the SHA-256 of a listing, one line
  "<sha256 of the file>  evidence/<path>" for each file under DIR, sorted
  by its path relative to DIR with "/" separators, then one line
  "<sha256 of FILE>  workbook", each line ending in a line feed. The same
  files give the same digest wherever they are; the workbook's name does not
  count.
- integrity --repository OWNER/NAME --sha SHA
  Fails unless the check run Repository integrity succeeded on SHA. It reads
  the check runs through the GitHub CLI.
- notes TAG
  Prints the release notes: the tag message, then the changelog section of
  the version.
- bundle REF --name NAME --out DIR
  Writes DIR/NAME-VERSION-source.tar.gz, a gzip of `git archive` of REF with
  no timestamp in the gzip header, and DIR/SHA256SUMS. The same REF gives the
  same bytes. VERSION is the tag's version, or the short commit for another
  ref, as in a rehearsal.
- verify-published TAG --repository OWNER/NAME [--milestone N]
  [--asset FILE=SHA256 ...]
  After publication, prints one line per fact and fails unless, with
  OWNER/NAME read back from GitHub in its canonical letter case:
  - TAG is annotated on GitHub and points at the commit its Candidate line
    names;
  - Repository integrity succeeded on that commit;
  - the GitHub Release of TAG is published, not a draft, and its notes name
    that commit;
  - its assets are exactly NAME-VERSION-source.tar.gz, SHA256SUMS and each
    FILE given; SHA256SUMS records exactly the bundle and its SHA-256, and
    each FILE has the SHA-256 given;
  - gh attestation verify passes on the bundle, as built by the Release
    workflow at TAG, unless the notes state that it is not attested;
  - with --milestone, milestone N is closed and has no open issue.
  It only reads, through gh: the assets are read into memory, and the bundle
  is copied to a temporary file, removed afterwards, for gh attestation.

Standard library only, apart from git, and gh for integrity and
verify-published. The Excel evidence gate imports tools/check_excel_run.py
only when evidence is given.
