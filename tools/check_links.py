r"""Check the links in the repository's Markdown files.

Offline, every relative link must name an existing directory or non-empty file
inside the repository, and every fragment must name a heading or an explicit anchor of
the Markdown file it points to. An external link must use HTTPS: a plain http://
link is an error, whether it is an inline link, a reference definition, an
autolink or an HTML attribute.

Links are read the way GitHub renders Markdown. A destination, an href or src
value and an <a id> or <a name> anchor are read with their backslash escapes
removed and their character references decoded (&amp; is &), then URL-decoded
(%20 is a space). Text in code spans, which may continue over line breaks, in
fenced and indented code blocks and in HTML comments is not a link, and neither
is text that only looks like one, such as \[text](path). Blockquote markers are
removed, and list-item markers read, before fences and headings are recognised.
A heading's anchor follows GitHub's slug rules, with the "_" runs that delimit
emphasis removed; the slug that keeps them is accepted too. The checker
approximates GitHub's renderer; it is not a full CommonMark parser.

A report the checker gets wrong is listed, with the reason, in
.github/link-check-exclusions.json. The file is optional; when present, its
form is

    {"schema_version": 1,
     "exclusions": [{"path": "docs/guide.md",
                     "link": "notes.md#part",
                     "reason": "GitHub renders this text as code"}]}

where path is the Markdown file and link is the link as the report prints it.
An entry that matches no report, or a malformed file, is an error, so the list
cannot go stale. A plain http:// link cannot be excluded.

With --external, each https link is also requested once, over HTTPS only and
without following a redirect to another protocol. Absolute links into this
repository itself are not requested, because a private repository answers 404
to anonymous requests; write links to its files as relative links, which the
offline check covers. A link to a page of the repository's wiki is the
exception: when the repository's own page answers an anonymous request, so the
repository is public, the page is requested as its raw Markdown, which answers
404 when the page does not exist; otherwise wiki links are skipped too. The
repository is --repository, else GITHUB_REPOSITORY, else the GitHub repository
of the origin remote, so a local run handles the same links as the workflow.

A 403, 429 or 5xx answer, or no answer at all, is a warning, not an error,
because the site may only be busy or refuse automated requests. To record that
such a link is known and still wanted, list it in .github/link-exceptions.json
with a reason and an expiry date; after that date the warning becomes an error,
so the exception is reviewed again. The file is optional; when present, its
form is

    {"schema_version": 1,
     "exceptions": [{"url": "https://example.org/page",
                     "reason": "Answers 403 to automated requests",
                     "expires": "2027-06-30"}]}

and the offline check fails while it is malformed or lists a URL that no
Markdown file links.
