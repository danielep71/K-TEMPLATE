"""Record an Excel run of the harness certification with one command, on Windows.

Usage: python tools/devbuild/excel_run.py [--evidence FOLDER] [--timeout SECONDS]
                                         [--enable-timeout SECONDS] [--operator NAME]

Run it in a clean checkout of the candidate commit, on Windows with Excel
installed. It replaces the manual steps of INSTALLATION.md, Recording an
Excel run, and never needs Trust access to the VBA project object model:

1. builds the development workbook with build_workbook.py, and stops if the
   build is not evidence-grade (a change in the checkout);
2. empties the evidence folder (default test-results/excel-run, which Git
   ignores; a folder under test-results/ is emptied, any other must be empty
   or absent);
3. opens the workbook read-only in a visible Excel through COM, from
   PowerShell started with -NoProfile and -EncodedCommand. It changes no
   macro setting: where Excel opens it with macros disabled, as under a
   policy that makes programs follow the user's macro setting
   (VALIDATION_PLAN.md, HB-02), you click Enable Content once, which enables
   them without reopening the workbook (HB-04), and the command waits for
   that, up to --enable-timeout seconds. Then it runs the certification entry
   point of the example suite and of each project suite the policy lists, in
   order, qualified with the workbook's name so that Application.Run reaches
   an Option Private Module module (HB-03), with the evidence folder and
   tests/fixtures, closes the workbook without saving and quits Excel. It
   records the process id and start time of the Excel instance it started,
   and if that instance is still running QUIT_WAIT seconds after it quits,
   it ends that process, never another one: a process whose name or start
   time differs is left alone. It prints how Excel ended (excel-quit:), and
   the report records it;
4. writes host.txt, the host record of docs/methodology/TEST_HARNESS.md:
   the operator (--operator, by default the Windows user), when the run
   started and finished, Windows from the registry, the Excel build, its
   bitness (from the EXCEL.EXE header), AutomationSecurity as Excel reports
   it (read, never set), the Trust access to the VBA project as the registry
   holds it, the references the build gives the project, compile=ON_DEMAND,
   because no automated run can compile the whole project without Trust
   access, so VBA compiled only the modules the run called (check_excel_run.py
   accepts it only with identity by rebuild, as step 5 checks it), and the
   outcome. It writes the record also when the run stops early: Excel
   unavailable, macros not enabled in time, a timeout, or a run that stopped
   before its end;
5. runs tools/check_excel_run.py with --workbook and --require-binding: with
   no exported folder it proves identity by rebuilding the commit and
   comparing the workbook's parts. It prints the report, and saves it
   beside the evidence folder as <folder>-report.txt, with how Excel ended.

It exits 0 when the check passes, 1 when it fails or the run could not
complete, and 2 for an invalid option, or when it is not run on Windows.
Standard library only.
It reads the macro setting and the Trust access only; it changes neither.
