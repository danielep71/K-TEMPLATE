"""Fail when a guide restates a count that has a single source.

Some counts live in one place: a policy file, a contract or the code of a
tool. tools/render_docs.py generates the ones a guide shows into blocks
between ``BEGIN generated`` and ``END generated`` markers, and Repository
integrity fails while a block is stale. A count copied into prose outside a
block has no such check, and goes stale silently when its source changes.

Each source is declared once in SOURCES, with a reader that returns its
current value and the noun phrases that name it:

- the cases and the assertions of the example suite, read from
  ``suite.expected_cases`` and ``suite.expected_assertions`` of
  .github/excel-evidence-policy.json;
- the modes of the example suite, and its failure entry points, the modes
  that must not pass, read from ``modes`` of the same policy;
- the Repository integrity checks that tools/check_repository.py lists, as
  the generated table of CONTRIBUTING.md shows them, and the static checks
  of exported VBA source among them, those that run a tools/check_vba_*.py;
- the datasets of docs/methodology/data-contract.json and the finding codes
  of tools/check_data_contract.py.

The issue label count is not a source here: tests/test_repository_consistency.py
already holds every label count the guides state equal to .github/labels.json.

A finding is a declared noun phrase preceded by a count, in digits (``14``,
``1,024``) or in words (``three``, ``thirty-four``, up to ninety-nine),
whatever its value: a stale copy is reported as well as a current one. The
number and the phrase may be separated by white space, a line break, and the
Markdown marks of emphasis and code spans, and nothing else, so
"34 ms", "issue #34", "v3.4", "step 6 checks" or a commit hash that contains
34 are not findings. A number that is part of a longer token, a version, an
issue reference or a path (preceded by a letter, digit, ``.``, ``#``, ``/``,
``$`` or ``-``) is not a count.

Scope: every tracked Markdown file except CHANGELOG.md, which records counts
as they were released, with the text of each generated block left out.

ALLOWED lists the restatements that are reviewed and kept, each as a file, the
phrase as the finding prints it, and the reason. An entry that matches nothing,
or that has no reason, is itself a finding.
