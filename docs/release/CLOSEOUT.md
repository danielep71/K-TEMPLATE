# 🧾 Milestone closeout

The record for closing a milestone: what was delivered, what evidence shows
it, and what closing it does and does not mean. Copy the template below into
an issue filed under the next milestone, not the one it closes, so that the
milestone can close while the record stays open
([release records](../../RELEASING.md#release-records)).

Every check of the record runs on one candidate commit. For a released
milestone, that is the candidate that
[RELEASING.md step 2](../../RELEASING.md#2-integrate-and-freeze-the-candidate)
freezes, the commit the tag names; if a release-gate fix replaces it, run the
checks again on the new one. Close the milestone only when the checklist is
complete for the candidate: every row links its evidence or records a
deviation. For a released milestone that is
[RELEASING.md step 7](../../RELEASING.md#7-publish-and-verify), before the
GitHub Release is published. Close this issue after the last step of its
sequence. Closing a milestone publishes nothing; a release follows
[RELEASING.md](../../RELEASING.md) separately.

When the milestone is released, check the published release as
[RELEASING.md step 7](../../RELEASING.md#7-publish-and-verify) describes:

```sh
python tools/release.py verify-published vX.Y.Z --repository OWNER/REPOSITORY \
  --milestone N --asset FILE=SHA256
```

With `--milestone`, it also fails unless the milestone is closed and has no
open issue. Add its output to the closeout issue. The download, the unblock
and the Excel checks of an attached workbook stay manual
([step 8](../../RELEASING.md#8-verify-the-published-workbook)).

## Template

```markdown
## Closeout: vX.Y.Z - <title>

### Sequence

| Step | Needs | Produces |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 1 | The milestone's remaining issues | Their changes merged and integrated into the default branch |
| 2 | Step 1; if I decide to release, RELEASING.md steps 1 and 2 | The candidate: the integration merge commit, or for a release the candidate of RELEASING.md step 2, in the candidate record |
| 3 | Step 2 | The file audit below, at the candidate |
| 4 | Step 3; for a release, RELEASING.md step 3 | The rest of the candidate record, the evidence index and the scope statement, at the candidate; every checklist row done |
| 5 | Step 4 | The milestone closed; for a release, in RELEASING.md step 7, before the GitHub Release is published |
| 6 | Step 5, for a release, once it is published | The output of `tools/release.py verify-published vX.Y.Z --repository OWNER/REPOSITORY --milestone N`, added to this issue |

### Checklist

| # | Criterion | Evidence | Done |
| ---: | --- | --- | :---: |
| 1 | Every issue of the milestone is closed with a Resolution, or moved with a reason | Evidence index | ☐ |
| 2 | The documented setup reproduces from a fresh checkout of the candidate | Candidate record | ☐ |
| 3 | Repository integrity is green on the candidate | Run link | ☐ |
| 4 | Live labels match the catalogue, and Issue triage passes | Live label drift and Issue triage run links | ☐ |
| 5 | Repository settings match the baseline when the candidate is checked: `setup_repository.py --check` | Dated evidence record | ☐ |
| 6 | The file audit covers every tracked file at the candidate | File audit | ☐ |
| 7 | The scope statement is recorded | This issue | ☐ |

### Candidate record

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Candidate commit | Full 40-character SHA on the default branch; for a release, the candidate of RELEASING.md step 2 |
| Integration and sync pull requests | #N, #N |
| Fresh checkout | `git status --short` printed nothing: yes or no |
| Repository checks | Commands run and their results |
| Tool versions | Git, Python and Node.js used |
| Hosted CI | Repository integrity run link and result |
| Deviations | None, or each criterion not met and my decision to accept it |

### Evidence index

| Issue | Subject | Evidence | Verified at candidate |
| --- | --- | --- | :---: |
| #N | Title | Its Resolution | ☐ |

### File audit

One row per tracked file, binary files included. A file changed after its
row was recorded is audited again.

| Path | Blob | Needed | Provenance | Findings | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| As `git ls-files` prints it | From `git ls-files -s` | Yes, or removed | Written here, or adapted with its third-party notice entry | None, or each problem | The pull request or issue |

### Scope statement

vX.Y.Z <title> is closed at commit <SHA>. It delivers <what>. It does not
certify <what it does not cover>; no version is released by this closeout.
Limitations: <list>.
